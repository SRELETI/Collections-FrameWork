#Why Collections are needed?

Different ways to initialize 10,000 objects in java.

1) declare and initialize 10,000 variables
2) declare an array of size 10,000.

*Problems with first approach-its a very bad coding practice and dims readability.*
*Problems with second approach:*
  1) Fixed size
  2) Can store only homogeneous items
  3) No underlying datastructure. So predefined methods. Everything has to be implemented by the programmer.
  
*Solution:*

Collections:
  1) Growable innature
  2) Homogeneous and hetrogeneous
  3) Underlying datastructure, So predefined methods.

# Difference Between Arrays and Collections?

*Arrays:*
  1) Fixed in nature
  2) Recommended - interms of performance
  3) Not Recommended - interms of memory
  4) No predefined methods
  5) Homogeneous
  6) Works for both Primitive and objects

*Collections:*
  1) Growable
  2) Recommended - interms of memory
  3) Not Recommended - interms of performance
  4) Predefined methods
  5) Hetrogeneous and Homogeneous
  6) Works for only Objects

*Collection: group of individual objects represented as a single entity.*
*Collections Framework: classes and interfaces required to represent group of individual objects as a single entity.*
